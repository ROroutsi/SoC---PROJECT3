# SoC - PROJECT3

Third bootcamp project based on tic tac toe data https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame, which had to be slightly modified for each part. 

It is composed by two parts:
 
 - Machine learning: Impliment a model which will predict the win or loss for the player using X based on the first 5 legal moves. Made use of KNN, with K=11 and accuracy = 0.833.

 - Big Data: Impliment a MapReduce algorithm on the dataset which will count the wins or losses based on the position of each X. Then upload the results of each part to hadoop hdsf.
